Smashing is a Sinatra based framework that lets you build beautiful dashboards.
The Smashing project is a fork of Dashing, an excellent framework created at Shopify
for displaying custom dashboards on TVs around the office.

This application allows you to update the content of a Smashing dashboard directly
from your Homey.

Smashing itself needs to be hosted somewhere else, like a computer, NAS or in
the cloud, where there are free services that can be used.
